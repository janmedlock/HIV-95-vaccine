Find target values that maximize the benefit for fixed cost.

The idea here is to make graphs of optimal incremental effectiveness
for many levels of cost.  Lines from the origin with slope
1 DALY / GDP per capita and 1 / 3 DALY / GDP per capita define the
thresholds.

Perhaps an upper bound for cost is
DALYs_basecase * 3 * GDP per capita per DALYs.
