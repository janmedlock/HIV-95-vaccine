This repository contains Python code and data used to simulate and
analyze HIV transmission in many (127, as of this writing) countries
around the world.

The scripts and model code are entirely written in Python3, using many
third-party libraries.  Most notably:
[Python3](http://www.python.org/),
[NumPy & SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
[cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/),
[Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/),
& [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
See [module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) for a full list: note
that many of the modules listed there are dependencies of the modules
listed above.

### Documentation

The full development documentation can be built using
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).  `make html` (using
[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or similar) in either
the root or [docs/](docs/) directories will build the documentation,
which will then be in *docs/_build/html/*.  The scripts, modules,
etc. mentioned below are covered in this documentation.

### Parameter data

* [data_sources/](data_sources/) contains the data used to
  parametrize the model and references to the sources of these data.

* [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx) contains a hand-curated version
  of [data_sources/](data_sources/), with fewer references to sources
  etc, that is parsed by the simulation code.

* [data_sheet_report.py](data_sheet_report.py) reports on the
  completeness of the data in [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx).

### Simulations

* [run_modes.py](run_modes.py) runs simulations using the modal
  parameter values.  This is fairly fast, tens of seconds for each
  country-target combination, approximately 10 cpu-hours for 127
  countries and 6 targets.  The result will be in *sim_data/modes.h5*,
  which is around 200MB for 127 countries and 6 targets.

* [run_vaccine_scenarios.py](run_vaccine_scenarios.py) runs different
  vaccine scenarios using the modal parameter values.  Again, this is
  as fast as [run_modes.py](run_modes.py) per country-target, but has
  7 targets instead of 6, so takes a little bit longer to run.  The
  result will be in *sim_data/vaccine_sensitivity.h5*, which is around
  450MB for 127 countries and 6 targets.

* [run_samples.py](run_samples.py) runs simulations using parameter
  samples.  **This is very slow**: it is only tens of seconds per
  sample-country-target, but the default is 1000 samples, so it takes
  tens of cpu-**days** to run everything.  The data from the runs will
  be in *sim_data/*, under a directory for each country, with a *.pkl*
  file for each target.  **The resulting total data generated for 127
  countries and 6 targets is around 315GB.**

We are currently exploring options for a public archive of the
simulation data we have generated.

### Post-processing

* [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py) sums the results to built
  results for regions and globally.  These are built in *sim_data/*
  directories for each region, one *.pkl* file for each target.

* [build_percentiles.py](build_percentiles.py) summarizes the median
  and a few percentiles of selected outcomes from the *.pkl* data from
  [runs_samples.py](runs_samples.py) to *sim_data/samples_stats.h5*
  for easier post-processing and plotting.  The resulting file is
  around 1GB for 127 countries and 6 targets.  Run
  [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py) first to ensure that the
  regional and global results also get converted.

### Plotting

The plotting scripts are in the [plots/](plots/) directory.  They
generally require having run the simulations and post-processing
tools.  A few highlights:
* [effectiveness.py](plots/effectiveness.py) uses data generated by
  [run_samples.py](run_samples.py) (and post-processed with
  [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py) &
  [build_percentiles.py](build_percentiles.py)) to make two sets of
  files:
  + *effectiveness.pdf* & *effectiveness.png* are graphs of selected
    outcomes globally and for a few selected countries.
  + *effectiveness_all.pdf* are graphs of selected outcomes for all
    regions and countries.  **This part is a bit slow, maybe a few
    minutes.**  You may want to comment out `plot_all()` to avoid
    running this part.

* [effectiveness_modes.py](plots/effectiveness_modes.py) uses data
  generated by [run_modes.py](run_modes.py) to make graphs of selected
  outcomes globally and for a few selected countries.

* [vaccine_sensitivity.py](plots/vaccine_sensitivity.py) uses data
  generated by [run_vaccine_scenarios.py](run_vaccine_scenarios.py) to
  make graphs of selected outcomes globally and for a few selected
  countries.

* [initial_prevalence_map.py](plots/initial_prevalence_map.py) uses
  the data in [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx) to make a choropleth
  map of 2015 prevalence.  **No simulation data is needed.**

* [transmission_rate.py](plots/transmission_rate.py) uses the data
  in [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx) to make a graph of estimated
  transmission rates for each country.  **No simulation data is
  needed.**

* [infections_averted_map.py](plots/infections_averted_map.py) uses
  data generated by [run_samples.py](run_samples.py) (and
  post-processed with [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py) &
  [build_percentiles.py](build_percentiles.py)) to make choropleth
  maps infections averted for selected targets.

* [infections_per_capita_averted_map.py](plots/infections_per_capita_averted_map.py)
  uses data generated by [run_samples.py](run_samples.py) (and
  post-processed with [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py)) to
  make choropleth maps infections per capita averted for selected
  targets.  **This is very slow—of minutes—and we haven't found the
  resulting maps useful.**

Note that the post-processing of PDF files uses `pdftocairo` from
[Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (in `pdfoptimize()` in
[plots/common.py](plots/common.py)) to reduce the size of the PDF
files and [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) (in
`pdf_add_info()` in [plots/common.py](plots/common.py)) to add
metadata.  Neither of these is necessary and can be commented out.

### Simulation code

The simulation code is in [model/](model/).  A few development test
scripts are in [tests/](tests/).  See the development documentation
in for more information.

### Miscellany

[module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) lists the library
versions that were used in running this
code.  [module_versions.py](module_versions.py) is used to generate
this list.  (Note: running [module_versions.py](module_versions.py) will
overwrite [module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) with the versions
on your computer, losing information about what is on my computer.
This may not be what you want to do.)
