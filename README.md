This repository contains Python code and data used to simulate and
analyze HIV transmission in 127 countries around the world.

The scripts and model code are entirely written in Python3, using many
third-party libraries.  Most notably:
[Python3](http://www.python.org/),
[NumPy & SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
[cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/),
[Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/),
& [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
See [module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) for a full list: note
that many of the modules listed there are dependencies of the modules
listed above.

### Documentation

The full development documentation can be built using
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).  `make html` (using
[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or similar) in either
the root or [docs/](docs/) directories will build the documentation,
which will then be in *docs/_build/html/*.  The scripts, modules,
etc. mentioned below are covered in this documentation.

### Parameter data

* [data_sources/](data_sources/) contains the data used to
  parametrize the model and references to the sources of these data.

* [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx) contains a hand-curated version
  of [data_sources/](data_sources/), with fewer references to sources
  etc., that is parsed by the simulation code.

* [data_sheet_report.py](data_sheet_report.py) reports on the
  completeness of the data in [data_sheet.xlsx](data_sheet.xlsx).

### Simulations

* [run_modes.py](run_modes.py) runs simulations using the modal
  parameter values.  This is fairly fast, tens of seconds for each
  country-target combination, approximately 10 cpu-hours for 127
  countries and 6 targets.  The resulting data will be in *sim_data/*,
  under a directory for each country, with a *-mode.pkl* file for each target.
  The resulting total data generated for 127 countries and 6 targets is
  around 140MB.

* [run_vaccine_scenarios.py](run_vaccine_scenarios.py) runs different
  vaccine scenarios using the modal parameter values.  Again, this is
  as fast as [run_modes.py](run_modes.py) per country-target, but has
  7 targets instead of 6, so takes a little bit longer to run.  The
  resulting data will be in *sim_data/*, under a directory for each country,
  with a *-mode.pkl* file for each target.    The resulting total data
  generated for 127 countries and 7 targets is around 164MB.


* [run_samples.py](run_samples.py) runs simulations using parameter
  samples.  **This is very slow**: it is only tens of seconds per
  sample-country-target, but the default is 1000 samples, so it takes
  tens of cpu-**days** to run everything.  The data from the runs will
  be in *sim_data/*, under a directory for each country, with a *.pkl*
  file for each target.  **The resulting total data generated for 127
  countries and 6 targets is around 136GB.**

We are currently exploring options for a public archive of the
simulation data we have generated.

### Post-processing

* [build_regionals.py](build_regionals.py) sums the results to built
  results for regions and globally.  These are built in *sim_data/*
  directories for each region, one *.pkl* file for each target.

### Plotting

The plotting scripts are in the [plots/](plots/) directory.  They
require having run the simulations and post-processing tools unless otherwise
noted.  A few highlights:
* [effectiveness.py](plots/effectiveness.py) makes graphs of selected
  outcomes globally and for a few selected countries.

* [effectiveness_regions.py](plots/effectiveness_regions.py) makes graphs of
  selected outcomes by region.

* [vaccine_sensitivity.py](plots/vaccine_sensitivity.py) makes graphs
  of selected outcomes globally and for a few selected countries.

* [initial_prevalence_map.py](plots/initial_prevalence_map.py) makes
  a choropleth map of 2015 prevalence.  **No simulation data is needed.**

* [infections_averted_map.py](plots/infections_averted_map.py) makes
  choropleth maps infections averted for selected targets.

* [transmission_rate.py](plots/transmission_rate.py) makes a graph of
  estimated transmission rates for each country.  **No simulation data is
  needed.**

### Simulation code

The simulation code is in [model/](model/).  A few development test
scripts are in [tests/](tests/).  See the development documentation
in for more information.

### Miscellany

[module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) lists the library
versions that were used in running this
code.  [module_versions.py](module_versions.py) is used to generate
this list.  (Note: running [module_versions.py](module_versions.py) will
overwrite [module_versions.txt](module_versions.txt) with the versions
on your computer, losing information about what is on my computer.
This may not be what you want to do.)
